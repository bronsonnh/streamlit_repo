# Dashboard for Examining Earthquake Trends in the Conterminous US 
By Nicholas Bronson
\n
Welcome to this Earthquake dashboard. All data used in this model was aquired from the
United States Geological Survey's earthquake database linked [here](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes).
\n
This dashboard provides insight on frequency, location, and magnitude of earthquakes
in the conterminous United States.
\n
The genesis of my idea to create this dashboard came from [this NPR article.](https://www.npr.org/2021/12/08/1062365995/50-earthquakes-hit-off-the-oregon-coast-but-scientists-say-theyre-no-great-shake)
This dashboard will allow users to look into the earthquake data, and filter it in several different manners.
Perhaps you can answer the question: Have earthquakes been increasing in number or severity in the US, particularly on the West Coast.

The graph below shows the number of earthquakes per year in the US, as you can see 2019-2021 it appears the number of earthquakes has increased.
While this graph does clearly demonstrate this, it is worth considering that perhaps measurement has become more precise, or more locations
that track earthquakes have come online.

# Conclusions and Next Steps
"""

"""
My conclusion is that there **does not** appear to be a significant uptick in earthquakes in 2021. While there has been a modest increase since 2020, it looks like 2011-2014 had a significantly higher number of earthquakes.
While I have come to this conclusion, there is certainly more work to be done. Please feel free to use the data below, or check out the [USGS website](https://www.usgs.gov/programs/earthquake-hazards/earthquakes) which has extensive information on earthquakes globally.
